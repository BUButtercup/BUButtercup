### Hello all!

I'm Nile (singular. Yes, just like the river). I'm a full-stack developer that truly loves the full stack! Whenever I'm working on an application, it always feels better if I've got a UI talking to a database somehow.

I'm currently working on reinforcing my knowledge through work on personal projects and hackathons, and expanding my knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and C#. And finding a job ðŸ˜†. If you know somebody who needs somebody, let me know!!

If you're working on a project, and you'd like another set of fingers that loves to learn and build great things, let me know!
